Hi There!

I am a Game Developer with over 6 years of experience bringing ideas to life through fun, polished, and well-performing games. Worked on everything from quick prototypes to full games, with a focus on Unity and clean, scalable systems. Known for taking full ownership, working fast, and always aiming for great gameplay. I am now self-employed and building original VR projects while following a long-time passion for creating games independently
